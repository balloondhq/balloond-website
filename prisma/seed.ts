      content: `
        <p>In the world of digital dating, we've become accustomed to making split-second decisions based on photos. But what if there was a better way to form genuine connections? At Balloon'd, we believe that voice-first dating represents a revolutionary approach to finding meaningful relationships.</p>

        <h2>The Science of Voice Connection</h2>
        <p>Research from leading psychology institutions shows that the human voice carries significantly more emotional information than visual cues alone. When we hear someone speak, our brains process not just the words, but also:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Emotional undertones and authenticity</li>
          <li>Personality traits and confidence levels</li>
          <li>Cultural background and communication style</li>
          <li>Energy and enthusiasm</li>
        </ul>
